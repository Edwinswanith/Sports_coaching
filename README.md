# Sports Coaching Platform

A multi-role mobile application for academies to manage athletes, training, attendance, wellness, recovery, performance, and coach ↔ athlete communication.

> **Core rule:** A coach only sees data for athletes assigned to that coach. Enforced in three layers (JWT → scope loader → route guard).

## Roles

- **coach** — sees only their assigned athletes
- **athlete** — sees only their own data
- **guardian** — sees only their linked athlete(s)

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Expo + React Native + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database:** MongoDB via Mongoose (Atlas in production, local or `mongodb-memory-server` in tests)
- **Auth:** JWT (httpOnly access + rotating refresh cookies) with bcrypt password hashing and per-IP login rate limiting

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- A MongoDB cluster (local or Atlas — Atlas requires the running IP to be on the cluster's IP allowlist)

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install all workspaces
npm install

# 2. Copy env templates
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example server/.env
cp .env.example mobile/.env

# 3. Seed the database (creates a demo academy with users, athletes, sessions, etc.)
npm run seed --workspace server

# 4. Run mobile + server in parallel
npm run dev
```

By default:
- Expo: <http://localhost:8081>
- API: <http://localhost:4000>
- Health check: <http://localhost:4000/api/health>

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Run mobile + server in parallel |
| `npm run dev:mobile` | Expo dev server |
| `npm run dev:server` | Express dev server with ts-node-dev |
| `npm run build` | Build server TypeScript |
| `npm run vercel-build` | Export Expo web to root `public/`, expose `backend/pages/api`, and run root `next build` |
| `npm test --workspace server` | Run Jest suite (uses `mongodb-memory-server`, no external Mongo needed) |
| `npm run seed --workspace server` | Populate the connected database with demo data |

## Vercel single-domain deployment

This repo deploys the Expo web UI and API routes on one Vercel URL.

- Vercel Root Directory: `./`
- Build Command: `npm run vercel-build`
- Install Command: `HUSKY=0 npm ci`
- Output Directory: leave empty/default
- Dashboard env vars: `MONGODB_URI`, `MONGODB_DB`, `AUTH_SECRET`

The build command exports the Expo web app with `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` empty, copies the static export into root `public/`, symlinks root `pages` to `backend/pages`, copies the root Next config, and runs `next build` from the repo root. Production web uses `window.location.origin`, so frontend requests go to same-origin `/api/*`.

For native iOS/Android builds, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the deployed Vercel URL, for example `https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app`.

## Demo accounts (after seeding)

| Role | Email | Password | Lands on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coach (3 athletes) | `coach.kumar@acme.test` | `Coach@123` | `/coach/dashboard` |
| Coach (1 athlete) | `coach.singh@acme.test` | `Coach@123` | `/coach/dashboard` (only sees Diya) |
| Athlete | `athlete.arjun@acme.test` | `Athlete@123` | `/athlete/dashboard` |
| Athlete | `athlete.bala@acme.test` | `Athlete@123` | `/athlete/dashboard` |
| Athlete | `athlete.chetan@acme.test` | `Athlete@123` | `/athlete/dashboard` |
| Athlete | `athlete.diya@acme.test` | `Athlete@123` | `/athlete/dashboard` |
| Guardian | `parent.rao@acme.test` | `Guardian@123` | `/guardian/dashboard` |

**Adding real users (coach-led onboarding):** beyond the seed, new users are provisioned in-app:
- An **academy owner** (a coach with `isAcademyOwner: true` — seeded as Coach Kumar) adds other **coaches** from `/coach/coaches`.
- Each **coach** adds their **athletes** (account + profile + roster assignment) and **guardians** (account + link) from `/coach/athletes/new`.
- Every created account gets a one-time temp password to hand over, and is nudged to set their own password on first sign-in (`/account`).

This is the deliberately role-scoped replacement for the removed admin provisioning — a coach can only create `athlete`/`guardian` accounts (and an owner additionally `coach` accounts) in their own academy. New coaches are not owners.

## Implemented features

### Auth (✅ shipped)

- `POST /api/auth/login` — bcrypt-verified login; returns `accessToken` and sets HttpOnly `accessToken` + `refreshToken` cookies (refresh scoped to `/api/auth`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production)
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` — rotates the refresh token, issues a new access token
- `GET /api/auth/me` — returns the authenticated user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — clears cookies and unsets `User.refreshTokenHash`
- Per-IP rate limit: **5 login attempts per 60 s** → `429 too_many_login_attempts`
- Security headers on every response: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`
- Mongo connection string is redacted in logs
- **Mobile client stores tokens in SecureStore** and sends the access token as a Bearer header through [mobile/src/lib/api.ts](mobile/src/lib/api.ts).

### Coach workspace (✅ shipped)

- `GET /api/coach/athletes` — coach's assigned roster only
- `POST /api/coach/athletes` — **coach-led onboarding**: creates a new athlete (`User` + `AthleteProfile`) and assigns them to the coach; returns a one-time temp password
- `POST /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/guardians` — adds a guardian for an assigned athlete (`User` + `GuardianAthleteLink`); reuses an existing guardian account if the email already belongs to one; returns a temp password for new guardians
- `GET/POST /api/coach/coaches` — **academy owner only** (a coach with `User.isAcademyOwner`): list / create coaches in the owner's academy (create returns a temp password). Non-owner coaches get `403 forbidden_not_owner`. This is a scoped provisioning capability, **not** a revived admin role.
- `GET /api/coach/dashboard?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — daily cards for each assigned athlete
- `GET /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/daily-card?date=` — single athlete card
- `POST /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/comment` — coach feedback visible to the athlete
- `GET /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/rpe-monitoring?date=` — assigned athlete's AM/PM RPE
- `POST /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/attendance` — coach records attendance (upsert/day)
- `POST /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/training/:slot` — coach sets the plan (type/plan/intensity/status)
- `POST /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/performance` — coach logs a performance entry
- `GET /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/performance?metric=&limit=` — performance history
- `GET /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/trends?days=7` — per-day readiness / load series for a sparkline
- `GET /api/coach/athletes/:athleteId/activity?limit=40` — merged recent-activity timeline
- All single-athlete routes run `requireAthleteAccess`, so a coach can only read/write assigned athletes
- **UI at `/coach/dashboard`**: KPI strip (assigned / present / sessions completed / avg readiness), per-athlete card showing attendance, AM/PM session, readiness, soreness, recovery, injury, RPE risk — plus an inline **feedback composer** that posts a coach comment

### Guardian workspace (✅ shipped)

Role-gated `guardian`, read-only, scoped to linked athletes (`GuardianAthleteLink`):

- `GET /api/guardian/athletes` — linked-athlete roster (summary only)
- `GET /api/guardian/athletes/:athleteId/daily-card?date=` — read-only daily summary
- `GET /api/guardian/athletes/:athleteId/coach-comments?date=` — coach feedback for a linked athlete
- `GET /api/guardian/athletes/:athleteId/trends?days=7` — read-only per-day trend series
- `GET /api/guardian/athletes/:athleteId/activity?limit=40` — read-only recent-activity timeline
- Access to a non-linked athlete returns `403 not_linked_guardian`; guardians have no write endpoints
- **UI at `/guardian/dashboard`**: linked-athlete picker, read-only daily card (attendance / readiness / sessions / recovery / injury / RPE risk), and coach feedback

### Athlete workspace (✅ shipped — Phase A)

Mobile-first single-column dashboard at **`/athlete/dashboard`**:

1. Today's Schedule (AM/PM session, injury restriction)
2. Daily Check-in (sleep, sleep quality, mood, stress, soreness, fatigue) → readiness score
3. Attendance (Present / Late / Absent)
4. Training Completion per slot (Completed / Partial / Missed)
5. Recovery Tracking (Stretching, Ice bath, Mobility, Physio, Hydration)
6. Notes to Coach
7. Coach Feedback (read-only)

Backed by `/api/athlete/*` — every endpoint scopes writes to the caller's own `athleteProfileId`; client-supplied `athleteId` is ignored. Athlete writes propagate to the coach dashboard on next refresh.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/athlete/me` | Own profile |
| `GET /api/athlete/daily?date=` | Own daily card (same shape as coach card) |
| `POST /api/athlete/wellness` | Upsert daily check-in |
| `POST /api/athlete/attendance` | Upsert attendance |
| `POST /api/athlete/training/:slot` | Update AM/PM session status |
| `POST /api/athlete/recovery` | Upsert recovery modalities |
| `POST /api/athlete/notes` | Append a note to coach |
| `GET /api/athlete/notes?date=` | Own notes for the day |
| `GET /api/athlete/coach-comments?date=` | Coach feedback for the day |
| `GET /api/athlete/trends?days=7` | Trailing per-day readiness / load / sleep / recovery series |
| `GET /api/athlete/activity?limit=40` | Merged recent-activity timeline (sessions, RPE, check-ins, comments…) |

### Health

- `GET /api/health` → `{ status: "ok", env }`

## RBAC enforcement (three layers)

1. **`requireAuth`** ([middleware/auth.ts](server/src/middleware/auth.ts)) — verifies the access token from `Authorization: Bearer` or the `accessToken` cookie, re-reads the user from Mongo, sets `req.actor = { userId, role }`.
2. **`loadScope`** ([middleware/coachAthleteAccess.ts](server/src/middleware/coachAthleteAccess.ts)) — populates `assignedAthleteIds` (coach), `linkedAthleteIds` (guardian), `athleteProfileId` (athlete), `academyId`.
3. **`requireRole(...)`** + **`requireAthleteAccess(param)`** — gate every scope-sensitive router and verify per-athlete access.

The athlete router additionally never accepts a client-supplied athlete id — every write goes to `req.actor.athleteProfileId` only.

## Data model

15 Mongoose models in [server/src/models/](server/src/models/):

`User`, `Academy`, `AthleteProfile`, `CoachAthleteAssignment`, `GuardianAthleteLink`, `Attendance`, `TrainingSession`, `Wellness`, `Recovery`, `Performance`, `Injury`, `AthleteNote`, `CoachComment`, `RpeMonitoring`, `AuditLog`.

Daily collections (`Attendance`, `Wellness`, `Recovery`, `TrainingSession`) have a unique compound index keyed by `(athleteId, date[, slot])`, so the athlete & coach endpoints simply upsert — "edit today's entry" is the same code path as "create today's entry."

## Tests

```bash
npm test --workspace server
```

Current count: **131 tests across 13 suites**, all passing — covering auth, the RBAC matrix, coach dashboard aggregation, the full athlete workspace (incl. wellness range validation, write rate-limiting, and cross-athlete isolation), RPE monitoring/readiness, coach write endpoints (attendance/training/performance), the guardian read API (linked-athlete isolation), the trends API (per-day readiness/load series + scope), the activity feed (merge/sort/scope), and coach-led onboarding (athlete/guardian account creation, temp-password login, duplicate/guardian-reuse handling, and cross-coach isolation).

## Current status

**Shipped:**
- Auth (login / refresh / logout / me, rate-limited, security headers, mobile Bearer auth)
- All three role workspaces with UI: **coach** (`/coach/dashboard`), **athlete** (`/athlete/dashboard`), **guardian** (`/guardian/dashboard`)
- Coach: dashboard + RPE view + write endpoints (comment / attendance / training plan / performance) with an inline feedback composer
- Athlete: daily workflow (check-in / attendance / training / recovery / notes ↔ coach) with input range validation + write rate-limiting
- Athlete RPE Monitoring — `RpeMonitoring` model with computed training load, risk flag + reasons, and readiness score; surfaced on the coach dashboard
- Guardian read API + UI (`/api/guardian/*`) — read-only linked-athlete roster, daily card, and coach comments
- Trends API + UI (`/api/*/trends`) — trailing per-day readiness/load/sleep series rendered as dependency-free SVG sparklines on the athlete, coach, and guardian views
- Activity API + UI (`/api/*/activity`) — merged, time-sorted timeline of sessions/RPE/check-ins/recovery/comments/notes/performance/injuries on the athlete and guardian views
- Premium **light** sports-performance UI: clean off-white backgrounds, white cards, lime accents, readiness rings, status chips, risk-sorted coach cockpit, condensed athletic type with tokens in [mobile/src/lib/theme.ts](mobile/src/lib/theme.ts)
- Server and mobile tests/typechecks passing

**Up next:**
- Sport-specific performance entry (athletics / badminton / etc.) driven by a shared metric catalog
- Coach UI forms for attendance/training-plan/performance (APIs shipped; only the comment composer is wired so far)

## Project blueprint

See [skills/sports-coaching-platform-builder/](skills/sports-coaching-platform-builder/) for the full architecture, database schema, RBAC matrix, API contract, UI flow, and step-by-step implementation plan.

Production deployments must provide non-placeholder `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `MONGODB_URI`.
