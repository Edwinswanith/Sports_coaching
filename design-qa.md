**Findings**
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 fidelity issues remain.

**Evidence**
- Source visual truth path: `c:\Users\bizzz\Downloads\ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2026, 02_42_43 PM.png`
- Source dimensions: `853 x 1844` pixels.
- Implementation screenshot path: `.codex/screenshots/emulator-native-exact-cross-verify.png`
- Implementation dimensions: `1080 x 2400` pixels from Android emulator `emulator-5554`.
- Native viewport: Android physical `1080 x 2400`, density `420`, font scale `1.0`, package `app.apex.coaching`, Today tab.
- Comparison artifact: `.codex/screenshots/design-qa-native-exact-comparison.png`
- Comparison normalization: reference and emulator screenshots were placed side by side in one image, both contained to a `1905px` comparison height with no cropping.
- State: authenticated athlete `Arjun`, Apex light theme, live local API data. The emulator state has no check-in, no RPE today, open sessions, hydration below goal, and no recovery log.

**Surface Review**
- Fonts and typography: compact uppercase labels, bold card headings, clear hierarchy, and no CTA/session wrapping in the native capture. The Readiness label stays on one line, the hero headline color is closer to the source orange, and the center Log label is visually suppressed to match the reference plus-only action.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the emulator first viewport now shows the reference structure: header, readiness hero, four metric cards, Today sessions, split Training Load and Needs Attention cards, full colour legend, and bottom navigation.
- Colors and visual tokens: warm off-white background, white cards, softer Android shadows, subtle borders, orange primary actions, green/amber/red/blue/purple semantic states, and the prominent orange center Log action match the reference direction.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the runner is an original raster asset at `mobile/assets/images/athlete-runner-hero.png`, placed on the right side of the readiness hero.
- Copy and content: live data is preserved. The reference’s sample values are intentionally not copied; missing values render as `--`, `No check-in yet`, and live empty-state copy.

**Comparison History**
- Iteration 1 findings: `.codex/screenshots/emulator-current.png` used a two-column metrics layout on the emulator, unlike the reference’s four-card row.
  Fixes made: widened the native breakpoint so this emulator width uses four metrics and split lower cards.
- Iteration 2 findings: `.codex/screenshots/emulator-after-breakpoint.png` had the right structure, but vertical density was too tall and pushed lower content out of the first viewport.
  Fixes made: added native compact styles for header, hero, metrics, sessions, lower cards, chart, and legend.
- Iteration 3 findings: `.codex/screenshots/emulator-native-after-tightening.png` showed the legend, but `READINESS` wrapped and the center Log button overlapped the legend.
  Fixes made: compacted the readiness label, reduced the lower-card height, and resized the center Log action.
- Iteration 4 findings: `.codex/screenshots/emulator-native-cross-verify.png` still had a beige active Today icon tile, a slightly brown hero headline, and heavier Android shadows than the reference.
  Fixes made: switched Athlete active nav to orange without the beige tile, matched the center action to the reference plus-only treatment, moved the empty hero headline toward source orange, and reduced Android shadow/elevation.
- Final evidence: `.codex/screenshots/emulator-native-exact-cross-verify.png` and `.codex/screenshots/design-qa-native-exact-comparison.png`.

**Open Questions**
- The source image shows populated sample data and iOS-style device chrome. The emulator uses Android chrome and the current live database state, so those differences are expected under the “do not hardcode” requirement.
- Current `DailySession` data does not expose scheduled clock times, so session rows show `Time --` rather than invented times.

**Implementation Checklist**
- Preserve API-backed readiness, metrics, hydration, training load, sessions, alerts, unread badges, and nav behavior.
- Keep the compact native layout for emulator-sized phones and the responsive small-phone fallbacks.
- Keep the original runner raster asset in the hero.

**Follow-up Polish**
- P3: If exact illustration proportions matter, regenerate the runner as a wider transparent-feeling scene so it blends more like the reference card.

**Focused Readiness Hero Pass**
- Source section crop: `.codex/screenshots/readiness-reference-crop.png`
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/readiness-clean-full.png`
- Final section crop: `.codex/screenshots/readiness-final-crop.png`
- Final focused comparison: `.codex/screenshots/readiness-final-comparison.png`
- Result: section proportions now match the reference card height, rounded shell, warm gradient, two-line helper copy, white-on-orange CTA, softened runner scene, compact readiness dial, and no stray zero-progress marker.
- Data caveat: emulator live data has no readiness check-in, so the section correctly renders `--/100` and `CHECK-IN NEEDED` instead of the reference's sample `82/100` and `READY TO TRAIN`.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Metrics And Sessions Pass**
- Source section crop: `.codex/screenshots/metrics-sessions-reference-crop.png`
- Initial emulator comparison: `.codex/screenshots/metrics-sessions-before-comparison.png`
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/metrics-sessions-final-v2-full.png`
- Final section crop: `.codex/screenshots/metrics-sessions-final-v2-crop.png`
- Final focused comparison: `.codex/screenshots/metrics-sessions-final-v2-comparison.png`
- Result: the four stat cards and Today's Sessions block now match the reference treatment more closely: white rounded cards, soft borders/shadows, compact title/link scale, pill statuses, slot chips, and bullet-separated session metadata.
- Data caveat: the emulator account currently has no sleep/recovery/session plan/RPE values, so the section correctly renders live empty values such as `--`, `0 L / 3 L`, `Open`, and `No RPE today` instead of hardcoded sample values like `8.2 h`, `Strength Training`, or `450 AU`.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Lower Dashboard Pass**
- Source section crop: `.codex/screenshots/lower-section-reference-crop.png`
- Initial emulator comparison: `.codex/screenshots/lower-section-before-comparison.png`
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/lower-section-final-v2-full.png`
- Final section crop: `.codex/screenshots/lower-section-final-v2-crop.png`
- Final focused comparison: `.codex/screenshots/lower-section-final-v2-comparison.png`
- Result: Training Load, Needs Attention, the colour legend, and bottom navigation now follow the reference treatment more closely: horizontal dashed load grid, white-on-orange load CTA, lighter card shadows, compact legend text, `High` legend copy, and centered red `View all`.
- Data caveat: emulator live data has no injury concern and no chat unread count, so it correctly omits the reference's hamstring row and chat badge while preserving live hydration/recovery alerts.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Legend And Bottom Nav Pass**
- Source section crop: `.codex/screenshots/legend-nav-reference.png`
- Initial emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/legend-nav-before-full.png`
- Initial focused comparison: `.codex/screenshots/legend-nav-before-compare.png`
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/legend-nav-final-full.png`
- Final section crop: `.codex/screenshots/legend-nav-final.png`
- Final focused comparison: `.codex/screenshots/legend-nav-final-compare.png`
- Viewport and normalization: source crop `810 x 258`, implementation crop `1008 x 430`; both were rendered side by side at `500px` comparison width per crop for visual review.
- Result: the compact colour legend now uses smaller optical text, smaller dots, and a tighter `Learn more` pill; the bottom navigation now uses an orange filled active Today icon, a white plus on the orange center action, the reference-style person icon for Coach, and smaller nav chrome.
- Data caveat: the reference crop shows a chat badge of `3`, while the emulator account currently reports no unread chat messages. The badge remains wired to live unread data and is intentionally not hardcoded.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Daily Log Pass**
- Source visual truth: inline Log reference image from the current user request, with implementation requirements in `C:\Users\bizzz\.codex\attachments\e1294288-59be-46ae-95cb-e18d01786279\pasted-text.txt`.
- Initial emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/log-before-full.png`.
- First compact pass screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/log-after-density-full.png`.
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/log-final-full.png`.
- Final focused crop: `.codex/screenshots/log-final-section.png`.
- Viewport and state: Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, Log tab, live API state with no sessions saved for the selected date (`0/3`, `0.0%`).
- Result: Today's Log now follows the reference's premium light mobile treatment: compact rounded log card, soft rest-day row, three equal session cards, orange selected state, segmented completion control, three-column workout fields, compact icon-led performance meters, `Session RPE` copy, notes/photo side-by-side layout, and visible orange `Save AM`.
- Data and behavior: existing rest-day, training slot save, RPE monitoring, and authenticated photo upload code paths were preserved. The live emulator state was not hardcoded to the reference sample values.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests; `npm test --workspace server -- --runInBand` passed 291 tests across 27 suites.

**Focused Log Scale Icon And Color Pass**
- Source visual truth: inline performance-input crop from the current user request.
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/log-colors-final-full.png`.
- Final focused crop: `.codex/screenshots/log-scale-colors-final.png`.
- Viewport and state: Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, Log tab, AM session selected with live form state.
- Result: the compact performance rows now use the reference-style bright orange for filled segmented bars and right-side numeric values, an orange Effort lightning icon, dark filled Planned intensity bars, dark Session RPE speedometer, dark Mood smiley, dark Soreness heart, and dark Fatigue clipboard inside soft circular icon wells.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Coach Section Pass**
- Source visual truth: inline Coach tab crop from the current user request showing Coach Updates, Coach Feedback, Recent Activity, and Coach-active bottom navigation.
- Initial emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/coach-before-full.png`.
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/coach-after-full.png`.
- Final focused crop: `.codex/screenshots/coach-section-final.png`.
- Viewport and state: Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, Coach tab, live announcements, empty feedback state, and API-backed activity feed.
- Result: the Coach tab section now follows the reference treatment more closely: compact white cards, orange section-header icons, announcement rows with soft icon wells, orange left rails and chevrons, inset empty feedback row, orange `View all` action, and a denser recent-activity timeline with smaller colored icon badges.
- Data caveat: visible update, feedback, and activity text remains live API data and was not hardcoded to the reference sample.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Bottom Nav Plus Position Pass**
- Source visual truth: inline bottom-navigation crop from the current user request showing the center plus button floating too high.
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/bottom-nav-plus-fixed-v2.png`.
- Final focused crop: `.codex/screenshots/bottom-nav-plus-fixed-v2-crop.png`.
- Result: the center Log plus button now sits inside the rounded bottom navigation shell instead of protruding above it, while keeping the orange filled action treatment and existing tab navigation behavior.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed.

**Focused Global Smoothness Pass**
- Source visual truth: repeated inline reference images from the user showing iOS-like smooth typography, soft shadows, warm white surfaces, rounded premium cards, and gentle orange/semantic color treatment.
- Final Today screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/smoothness-today-final.png`.
- Final Coach screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/smoothness-coach-final.png`.
- Final Log screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/smoothness-log-final.png`.
- Final nav crop: `.codex/screenshots/smoothness-nav-final.png`.
- Result: global text rendering now uses lighter Inter weight mapping and removes Android font padding; shared theme surfaces are warmer/lighter; shared cards, header controls, date/profile popovers, dashboard cards, coach/log cards, text inputs, and the bottom navigation use lower elevation with broader softer shadow blur for a smoother iOS-style finish.
- Data caveat: emulator screenshots preserve the authenticated athlete's live local API state and Android status/navigation chrome, so values and device chrome intentionally differ from the iOS-like reference mockups.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Background Blend Pass**
- Source visual truth: full uploaded Today dashboard reference at `C:\Users\bizzz\Downloads\ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2026, 02_42_43 PM.png`.
- Initial emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/background-blend-today-before.png`.
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/background-blend-after.png`.
- Final comparison: `.codex/screenshots/background-blend-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and normalization: source `853 x 1844` scaled to implementation height; implementation `1080 x 2400` from Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`.
- State: Today tab, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, live API values retained.
- Result: the Today page now uses a warmer full-screen backplate, lower-contrast section borders, softer shared card shadows, a subtle page gradient under the ScrollView, and a left fade over the runner artwork so the hero image blends into the card background instead of reading as a separate rectangle.
- Findings: no actionable P0/P1/P2 background, shadow, or surface-blend mismatches remain for this focused pass. Remaining differences are expected live-data/device-state differences: Android chrome, current time, athlete name, unread count, and empty API values.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Today Vertical Spacing Pass**
- Source visual truth: full uploaded Today dashboard reference at `C:\Users\bizzz\Downloads\ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2026, 02_42_43 PM.png`, specifically the Today sessions, lower cards, colour legend, and bottom navigation spacing.
- Initial emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/today-spacing-after-v2-reload.png`.
- Overshoot iteration screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/today-spacing-after-v3b.png`.
- Final emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/today-spacing-final-clean.png`.
- Final comparison: `.codex/screenshots/today-spacing-final-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and normalization: source `853 x 1844` scaled to implementation height; implementation `1080 x 2400` from Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`.
- State: Today tab, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, live API values retained.
- Result: the Today screen no longer leaves a large empty strip between the colour legend and bottom navigation. The four stat cards, Today's Sessions rows, session-card spacing, and colour legend height were increased to match the reference's vertical rhythm while keeping all lower dashboard sections visible above the nav.
- Comparison history: the first sizing pass still left a visible bottom gap; the second pass made Today's Sessions too tall and pushed the lower cards under the nav; the final pass balanced the session rows and legend so the final screen has the reference-style section gaps and no dead bottom space.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Legend Clearance And No-Scroll Pass**
- Source visual truth: current user emulator screenshot showing the `What the colours mean` card partially clipped under the bottom nav, plus the uploaded Today dashboard reference at `C:\Users\bizzz\Downloads\ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2026, 02_42_43 PM.png`.
- Final emulator screenshot before swipe: `.codex/screenshots/today-no-scroll-final-before-swipe.png`.
- Final emulator screenshot after swipe: `.codex/screenshots/today-no-scroll-final-after-swipe.png`.
- Final comparison: `.codex/screenshots/today-no-scroll-final-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`, Today tab, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, live API values retained.
- Result: the legend card is now fully visible above the bottom navigation with no clipped lower edge. The Today screen was trimmed through real component heights, not filler padding, and Today overscroll/bounce was disabled so the screen does not move on a normal vertical swipe when content fits.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

**Focused Global Surface Blend Pass**
- Source visual truth: full uploaded Today dashboard reference at `C:\Users\bizzz\Downloads\ChatGPT Image Aug 5, 2026, 02_42_43 PM.png`, specifically the warm full-page backplate, low-contrast white cards, soft card shadows, header controls, Log/Coach section cards, and bottom navigation shell.
- Initial emulator screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/surface-blend-before.png`.
- Final Today screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/surface-global-today.png`.
- Final Log screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/surface-global-log.png`.
- Final Coach screenshot: `.codex/screenshots/surface-global-coach.png`.
- Final comparison: `.codex/screenshots/surface-global-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: Android emulator `emulator-5554`, package `app.apex.coaching`, authenticated athlete `Arjun`, live API values retained.
- Result: shared mobile surface tokens now use a warmer off-white page background, warm-white raised cards, paler inset controls, lower-contrast borders, and broader/lower-opacity shadows. The same treatment was applied to shared cards, AppFrame nav/header controls, date/profile surfaces, Today cards, Log inputs/cards, and Coach panels so the app reads as one blended iOS-style surface system instead of separate gray Android cards.
- Additional fix: removed the invalid `sound: "default"` Android notification-channel setting in `mobile/src/lib/push.ts`, which was opening Expo LogBox over emulator captures because no custom sound is bundled.
- Validation: `npm run typecheck --workspace mobile` passed; `npm run lint --workspace mobile` passed with 10 existing warnings; `npm test --workspace mobile -- --runInBand` passed 85 tests.

final result: passed
